# Pinecone and LangChain Integration Project

This project demonstrates the integration of **Pinecone**, a vector database, with **LangChain** for enhanced text retrieval capabilities. The notebook showcases how to set up Pinecone, install the necessary dependencies, and use its services to store and retrieve vector embeddings.

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to:
- Install and configure Pinecone-related packages.
- Use Pinecone's cloud service to store and retrieve vector embeddings.
- Integrate Pinecone with **LangChain**, a framework designed for building applications that involve language models and information retrieval.

## Key Technologies
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for storing high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and performing efficient searches on them.
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications that are powered by language models, allowing them to interact with other data sources like Pinecone.
  
## Features
- Set up Pinecone with your API key.
- Install necessary libraries for Pinecone and LangChain.
- Run retrieval tasks using Pinecone's powerful search capabilities.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages via pip. You can do this directly within the notebook or from your terminal:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pinecone-client pinecone-text pinecone-notebooks
```

### 2. Configure Pinecone API
To use Pinecone, you'll need an API key. Set it up within your notebook:
```python
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Start Using Pinecone with LangChain
Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is configured, you can start utilizing Pinecone for vector search in combination with LangChain.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install the necessary libraries as prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to set up Pinecone and connect it with LangChain for hybrid search functionality.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python packages:
- `pinecone-client`: The official Pinecone client for Python.
- `langchain`: A powerful library for connecting language models with external databases and APIs.
- `tqdm`: A progress bar library.
- `typing-extensions`: Provides backports of type hints.

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced use cases for vector search.
- Explore other retriever frameworks with Pinecone.
